This repository contains mini projects focused on building web applications using different **Python** web frameworks such as Flask, Django, and FastAPI. Each project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a simple web app: setting up the framework, defining routes and views, handling HTTP requests, working with templates or APIs, and managing basic data operations. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with multiple Python web stacks, compare their patterns and strengths, and build a solid foundation for developing scalable, production-ready web applications.
